There are over 1.7 billion people without access to banks and basic financial services.\n\nUnemployment\nThe pandemic caused high unemployment rates around the world, mainly affecting the low-income population where working at home is not an option. Over 200 million unemployed people worldwide and over 15 million in Brazil. There are over 10 million people living in Favelas (Slums) in Brazil alone.\n\nWealth Gap\nThe poorest half of the global population owns just 2% of the global total, while the richest 10% own 76% of all wealth.\n\nDrug trafficking\nDrug trafficking is unfortunately considered a real career in the underserved communities in Brazil. Teens start out earning between 10 and 20 dollars a week to deliver drugs, but they participate in a hierarchical structure that allows them to move up and increase their salaries, reaching up to 500 dollars a week if they continue to be “promoted”. The idea of ​​P4C is to reach these teenagers at the beginning of their “career”, where we believe that young people are not completely dazzled by the world of crime and when they see these opportunities they can change their life direction.\n",

We will make 10 sessions about Blockchain, NFTs, Metaverse and P2E games inside 10 different communities in Brazil, in partnership with NGOs that are already working inside those Favelas. Community members from Coinbase will be always invited to the meetings. (ETC: 2 weeks per community, Total 20 weeks)\n- Invest in courses to train artists, programmers and designers to become crypto upskilled and mentor the community members. We will also hold meet-ups with leaders from these communities and NGOs to get them onboard with the program. Partner with Spanish crypto content platform to reach communities in Latin America starting with Venezuela.  (ETC: 3-5 months)\n- Invest in NFT games to onboard new Scholars and expand our program to more communities in Brazil. Open axie infinity teams in Venezuela and Nigeria to generate income for families in need in those areas. (ETC: 2 - 4 months)\n- Structure the Play4Change NFT Art Project, which will have NFTs created by artists from the favelas in Brazil providing alternative income for them as well as our own NFTs exposed to engage the community in participating in our growth. (ETC: 3 months)\n- Maintain the core team to support these efforts. (6 months)\n",

Lack of crypto-economics for Net positive mobility \n    \n    Most net positive mobility solutions rely on extractive and degenerative business models to operate, where users exchange privacy on their personal data to use private goods as public goods and mobility benefits are not tracked or are diluted for an economic benefit.

The way to earn these tokens is by contributing to the community and advancing educational content. Once we receive sponsors and have a treasury, the idea is for the community to decide how to use those funds: funding projects, sending groups of members to hackathons, organizing community events, etc...\n\n## Initial project ideas\n\nCreating a DAO to make validator nodes more accessible and encourage decentralization by creating \"The World's Highest Validator Node\", an information group to get government institutions to remove the cryptocurrency ban, a diploma course to learn about blockchain, etc…\n",

Creemos que se debe, únicamente, a un problema de poco acceso a información, lo que buscamos con la comunidad Cripto Curiosas, es educar a más mujeres para que puedan aprender más del ecosistema y encontrar un lugar en cual desenvolverse. De esta forma, también pueden aprender sobre finanzas en crypto y ya no depender de otras personas para tomar sus decisiones.\nMinoría de mujeres en crypto / brecha de género. En el ecosistema crypto hay una gran brecha de género; sin embargo, según estudios muchas mujeres tienen interés en conocer más sobre este ecosistema, pero algunas se sienten intimidadas por ser un “espacio de hombres”. Cripto Curiosas busca ser ese puente para que ellas puedan pasar de web2 a web3, es un espacio seguro, donde se les pueda dar la confianza para desenvolverse y expresar todas sus dudas respecto al ecosistema.\nBarrera del idioma: Es un problema para el acceso a la información sobre Web 3 y nuevas tecnologías, la mayor parte de información se encuentra en inglés y esto complica a algunas mujeres. Por lo que la comunidad, tiene como objetivo impactar con contenido en español, fácil de entender, sin tantos tecnicismos y de forma didáctica.\nFalta de seguridad: Las mujeres temen ingresar al ecosistema porque no se sienten seguras de sí mismas, algunas dudan de sus capacidades. Esto termina intimidándolas y siendo una barrera para su ingreso al ecosistema. En Cripto Curiosas, brindamos acompañamiento emocional desde el primer instante en el que ingresan a la comunidad, las ayudamos a empoderarse, inspirarse y aprender de las experiencias de otras mujeres que como ellas empezaron teniendo dudas de sí mismas. Así mismo, estamos en constante comunicación para saber cómo se sienten emocionalmente y brindarles el apoyo necesario, a través de nuestra líder de gestión emocional. ",

Existen programas que pueden tener precios altos y no resultar siendo accesibles para todas, ya que muchos países de LATAM se encuentran pasando por crisis económicas y devaluación de la moneda, por lo que, no tienen como necesidad básica los gastos por educación. Lo que buscamos es resolver ese problema, brindando 100 becas en diferentes programas; por ejemplo, Platzi. La beca es de un mes, pero puede extenderse dependiendo de las horas de estudio que haya tomado la becada.\n\nBuscamos generar talleres presenciales y virtuales, con algunas invitadas que ya hemos tenido en nuestros Twitter spaces. Con ellas buscamos inspirar y hacer el onboarding de web2 a web3. Los gastos de vuelos, representación y estadías, estarían cubiertos por Cripto Curiosas. Así mismo, dependiendo el país en el que se hagan los diferentes talleres y meetups, se llevarían becadas a algunas mujeres de la comunidad. La beca cubriría gastos de alimentación, vuelo y estadía. \n\nTenemos como uno de los objetivos, impulsar el aprendizaje de la comunidad, desarrollando una Hackathon al año, en donde mujeres de Cripto Curiosas y público en general, puedan aplicar lo aprendido con la comunidad creando diferentes proyectos. Cripto Curiosas cubriría todos los gastos, desde alquiler del espacio, alimentación para los asistentes (desayuno, almuerzo y cena), gestión con speakers y líderes del ecosistema. En esta Hackathon, también se becarían a miembros de la comunidad que viven fuera del país en donde se realizará el evento, esta beca cubre todos sus gastos. \n\nDentro de la comunidad tenemos contribuyentes que suman con su talento a las diferentes acciones que desarrollamos, por lo que queremos entregar bounties a las mujeres que dedican parte de su tiempo a construir dentro del ecosistema con Cripto Curiosas. Diseñadoras, redactoras, hosts, creadoras de contenido, desarrolladoras, todas, independientemente de la profesión que tengan serán recompensadas.\n\nPara terminar, buscamos dejar un recuerdo en los diferentes eventos o acciones, por lo que tenemos pensado diseñar merch, como tazas, cuadernos, lapiceros, bolsas, hoodies, polos, llaveros, pulseras, gorros, entre otras cosas.

We need them to understand the importance of decentralization, self-custody, and ownership, among many other practical things.\n  \n**UX**: we also need far better UX. Crypto nowadays is difficult and won't be mass adopted if many things don't change first. And when I say UX, we don't mean design and buttons. We mean better and easier tools and technologies: account abstraction, layer 2, mobile nodes, easier DeFi protocols, etc. To accomplish this, we need a lot **more builders** than we have today.

          "description": "Did you know that every 2 minutes Hello 3 people make the decision to commit suicide. and what decisions do you make? Hello everyone, we send you a big hug from one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. From Colombia, in the municipality of Salento, Quindío, Biolumen was born, a hybrid project between territory protection and blockchain technology that seeks to develop high-impact projects with environmental responsibility. Biolumen is led by two cousins, Luis Alejandro Toro and Jhon Harvey Tejada, who belong to a traditional coffee-growing family that is dedicated to the production of natural products from the extraction of medicinal plants. We were lucky to grow up in a home full of awareness and respect for life itself, learning about medicinal plants and enjoying the magic of Nature. The first generation of our family dedicated themselves to coffee cultivation, contributing to the constitution of these Salento lands belonging to the PCC as a cultural heritage of humanity. The second generation found in medicinal plants an opportunity for sustainable development, building a company dedicated to the production of natural products and an eco-park whose thematic axes are ethnobotany and Bioluminescence. At this moment, the third generational change is taking place where the two cousins ​​are building a project that tries to transmit all these values ​​of environmental awareness, using blockchain technology. Technology that represents an opportunity for change for humanity. Biolumen is made up of 3 pillars. 1. It is the construction of immersive tours that allow us to offer a conscious tourism and digital classrooms that allow us to share knowledge about the biodiversity of planet Earth. 2. The Tokenization of carbon bonds to offset the carbon footprint, we believe that environmental commitment is part of everyone and we trust that companies will also join this chain of environmental sustainability. 3. Just as rivers are born from our mountains, we dream of being the generators of projects with high impact and environmental responsibility, that is why we want to build a business ecocenter that will be the research and work headquarters of decentralized autonomous organizations ( DAO ) and academies who want to contribute to the construction of a better world. We invite you to discover one of the places with the highest biodiversity per square meter in the world. We are waiting.",

          "description": "# Historia\n\nSenda Verde nace el 2003 con la finalidad de rescatar y proteger a animales que son víctimas del abuso y tráfico animal o de situaciones donde sus hábitats son destruidos dejándolos sin un refugio y/o en peligro de muerte.\n\nSenda Verde ha construido un santuario para los animales silvestres donde puedan recuperarse o crecer en condiciones dignas, con el amor y cuidado que ellos merecen. Este santuario se encuentra en Bolivia, el corazón de Sudamérica y tiene como colaboradores a un equipo que dedica su energía, esfuerzo y trabajo a esta noble tarea, como así también lo hacen los voluntarios que visitan el santuario y dejan su granito de arena al unirse al proyecto.\n\nA la fecha Senda Verde ha acogido a mas de 1000  animales silvestres dándoles una nueva oportunidad de vida y regalando esperanza, no solo al mundo animal y la vida silvestre sino a todo aquel que se involucra con la visión del proyecto, desde comunidades indígenas hasta los benefactores desde distintas partes del mundo. Nada de esto seria posible sin el liderazgo, visión y amor con los que Vicky y Marcelo, las cabezas de Senda Verde han puesto día a día en la construcción del Refugio.\n\n# Visión\n\nGuiados por el propósito de crear un planeta más sano, nuestra visión es un mundo más rico en naturaleza donde la vida silvestre prospere. Hemos visto una enorme oportunidad de ampliar nuestro modelo con Web3, gracias a los recientes avances en las finanzas regenerativas y el apoyo a los bienes públicos. \n\nEntre las oportunidades que trae web3, hemos identificado 3 usos relevantes para la Senda Verde:\n1. El código abierto permite que este modelo sea replicable en más refugios de animales y crear una red de refugios que se apoyen mutuamente\n2. NFTs y SBTs (Soulbound tokens) con los que recompensar a voluntarios, artistas y donantes que apoyan a la Senda Verde\n3. Un metaverso para tener acceso a la red de refugios, sin necesidad de visitarlos físicamente\n\n# Cómo funciona:\n\nVoluntarios visitan Senda Verde cada tanto, entre ellos muchos se destacan por la habilidad de crear arte inspirados en la experiencia que viven al visitar el santuario y compartir con los animales, escuchar sus historias etc. Como así también lo han hecho artistas que colaboran con Senda Verde o personas que son parte del equipo. Todos ellos comparten un sentimiento de querer colaborar con el bienestar de estos animales a través de su arte. \n\nEstas obras de arte (pintura, fotografia, dibujo o incluso música) gracias a la web3 tienen mucho potencial de generar ingresos económicos que ayuden a darle sostenibilidad a la Senda Verde. Por lo cual los utilizaremos para crear colecciones NFT que no sólo generen sostenibilidad, sino también conciencia social, entretenimiento, compromiso y un sentimiento de comunidad.\n\nEstas colecciones NFT se desarrollaran de la siguiente manera:\n\nSe genera un arte NFT a partir de una donación por parte del artista\nEl artista recibe un SBT como insignia de su colaboración, un SBT el cual podrá coleccionar en un “Green Passport” que le permitirá coleccionar más insignias en cuanto a donaciones o aportes realice e incluso coleccionarlas en otros refugios\nYa teniendo la colección curada y estructurada según la temática, los coleccionistas podrán acceder a distintas experiencias según el NFT que compren:\n\n- Tier 1: Un NFT con un aporte mínimo que les da una insignia de colaboración (Aprox 70$) por la cual recibe una “postal” HD del arte del mes.\n\n- Tier 2: Un NFT que te permita “apadrinar” un animal dentro de Senda Verde (Aprox 140$) por el cual recibe un certificado de apadrinamiento y cada semana recibe una fotografía del animal que adoptó por 2 meses\n\n- Tier 3: Un NFT como benefactor de Senda Verde por el cual tiene acceso a las cámaras en vivo del refugio, apadrinamiento de un animal silvestre y acceso al metaverso.\n\n- Tier 4: Un NFT como SV friend por el cual puede apadrinar, acceder a las cámaras, interactuar en el metaverso, recibir merchandising fisico y ademas recibe un gold member pass que le da acceso a videos exclusivos para el/ella y hospedaje en senda verde el cual puede utilizar o donarlo a un turista/voluntario de paso.\n\nComo podemos ver es un modelo circular donde todos obtienen un beneficio pero sobre todo, los animales que pueden tener un refugio digno, además es flexible para innovar en muchas maneras y replicable para otros países.\n\n*//English version//*\n\n\n# The Story of Senda Verde\n\nSenda Verde was born in 2003 with the purpose of rescuing and protecting animals that are victims of animal abuse and trafficking, as well as situations where their habitats are destroyed leaving them without shelter and/or in danger of death.\n\nSenda Verde has built a sanctuary for wild animals where they can recover or grow in dignified conditions, with the love and care they deserve. This sanctuary is located in Bolivia, the heart of South America and has a team of collaborators who dedicate their energy, effort and work to this noble task. There are also volunteers who visit the sanctuary and leave their grain of sand by joining and collaborating with the project.\n\nTo date, Senda Verde has taken in more than 1000 wild animals, giving them a new opportunity to live and giving hope, not only to the animal and wildlife world, but to everyone who gets involved with the vision of the project: from indigenous communities to benefactors from different parts of the world. None of this would be possible without the leadership, vision and love with which Vicky and Marcelo, the heads of Senda Verde, have put day by day for the construction of the refuge.\n\n# Vision\n\nGuided by the purpose of creating a healthier planet, our vision is a world richer in nature where wildlife thrives. We have seen a tremendous opportunity to expand our model with web3, thanks to recent advances in ReFi (regenerative finance) and support for public goods. \n\nAmong the opportunities that web3 brings, we have identified 3 relevant uses for Senda Verde:\n1. Open source allows this model to be replicable in more animal shelters and create a network of mutually supportive shelters.\n\n2. NFTs and SBTs (Soulbound tokens) with which to reward volunteers, artists and donors who support Senda Verde.\n\n3. A metaverse to access the network of animal shelters and rewilding projects, without the need to visit them physically.\n\n# How it works:\n\nVolunteers visit Senda Verde from time to time. Many stand out for their ability to create art inspired by the experience of visiting the sanctuary and sharing with the animals, listening to their stories etc… There are also artists who collaborate with Senda Verde and people who are part of the fixed team. All of them share a feeling of collaboration with the welfare of these animals through their art. \n\nThese works of art (painting, photography, drawing or even music), especially now thanks to the web3, have a lot of potential to generate economic income that will help with the long-term sustainability of Senda Verde. Therefore we will use them to create NFT collections that not only generate sustainability, but also social awareness, entertainment, engagement and a sense of community.\n\nThese NFT collections will be developed as follows:\n\nNFT art is generated from a donation by the artist.\nThe artist receives an SBT as a badge for their contribution. An SBT which can be collected in a \"Green Passport\" that will allow visitors and volunteers to collect more badges in terms of donations or contributions made and even collect them in other animal shelters and rewilding projects.\nOnce the collection is curated and structured according to the theme, collectors will be able to access different experiences depending on the NFT they buy:\n\n- Tier 1: An NFT with a minimum contribution that gives them a collaboration badge,  for which they receive an HD \"postcard\" of the month's art piece.\n\n- Tier 2: An NFT that allows you to \"adopt\" an animal within Senda Verde for which you receive an adoption certificate as an SBT. This NFT includes a photo of your adopted animal every week for 2 months.\n\n- Tier 3: An NFT as a benefactor of Senda Verde for which you have access to the live cameras of the shelter, adoption of a wild animal and access to the rewilding metaverse.\n\n- Tier 4: An NFT as a SV fellow, for which you can adopt, have access to the cameras, interact in the metaverse, receive physical merchandising and also receive a gold membership that gives you access to exclusive videos and lodging in Senda Verde.\n\nAs we can see it is a circular model where everyone gets a benefit but above all, the animals that can have a dignified shelter, it is also flexible to innovate in many ways and replicable for other countries.\n\n\n",

With this solution, we aim to provide the opportunity for the emergency system in Honduras to efficiently digitalize events that occur on a daily basis, uploading these to the blockchain for safekeeping and transparency. With the stored and unmanipulated data, Honduran entities can analyze and interpret this information in order to assist in their preemptive efforts to prevent accidents.\n\nThis protocol will also be able to onboard a wide range of people to the blockchain ecosystem, furthermore displaying the advantages of a decentralized platform.\n",

          "problemSpace": "In present Honduras, the emergency system uses outdated and traditional ways to keep track of the events they attend to.\n\nFor example: Fire Fighters are called by a centralized 911 department. Once they attend an emergency, Fire Fighters are expected to report the incidents via WhatsApp in real-time. Once the emergency is over and they return to their central station, they are expected to fill a written report. It has come to our attention that these written reports can be damaged over-time with the weather alone, losing track of valuable information that could assist in preventing emergencies in the future for our community.\n\nWhile this solution could be provided by centralized tools, the lack of transparency encourages solutions like blockchain to prevent the manipulation of information. Enabling our citizens with a system that they can trust that won't be altered would highly boost the country's transparency.\n\nAll-in-all with the high levels of under-development our country is currently experiencing, a solution like this would be a step in the right direction.",
