General guidelines:

- Plan and confirm with the user before executing
- Stay focused. Do not "go rogue", if you want to fix things that weren't asked, ask the user first.

TypeScript Conventions:

- Use interfaces over types when possible
- Avoid enums, use const objects instead

Code Style:

- Use functional programming patterns
- Avoid side effects where possible
- Use small, reusable pure functions
- Implement proper error handling
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write self-documenting code

Figma Asset Export:

- When working with Figma designs, use the generated asset URLs from the Figma code tool
- Export assets directly from Figma when localhost URLs are not accessible
- Use this command pattern for downloading Figma assets:

  ```bash
  cd /path/to/public/images && \
  curl -o asset-name.png "http://localhost:3845/assets/[asset-id].png"
  ```

- For direct Figma export: Select asset → Right-click → Export → Choose format → Save to public/images/
- Name assets descriptively: `provider-logo.png`, `icon-name.svg`, etc.
- Always verify asset accessibility before implementing in code
