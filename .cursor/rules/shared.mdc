General guidelines:

- Plan and confirm with the user before executing
- Stay focused. Do not "go rogue", if you want to fix things that weren't asked, ask the user first.

TypeScript Conventions:

- Use interfaces over types when possible
- Avoid enums, use const objects instead

Code Style:

- Use functional programming patterns
- Avoid side effects where possible
- Use small, reusable pure functions
- Implement proper error handling
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write self-documenting code
