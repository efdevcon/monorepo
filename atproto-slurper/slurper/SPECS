So I'm working with atproto to ingest events that adhere to a specific lexicon:

https://atproto-browser.vercel.app/at/did:plc:dhnigydy24fp542wu5sxqy33/com.atproto.lexicon.schema/org.devcon.event.test

For this, I need two things:
    - Listen to the firehose
    - A fallback for people who have PDSs not connected to the firehose - e.g. 

Filter events that match the above lexicon

If they match, save them to supabase

Save the "cursor" in supabase to be able to recover from downtime
