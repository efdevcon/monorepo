faq:
  - question: Can I apply to speak?
    answer: >
      We don't have speaker applications for "Ethereum Day" at La Rural on Nov
      17th, since we will invite speakers directly. Some community events which
      are independently organized might be looking for speakers. Keep an eye on
      the [Devconnect calendar](/calendar) and reach out to the organizers
      directly for inquiries.
  - question: How do I get a visa invitation letter?
    answer: >
      We are collaborting with the Argentine Immigration Office to provide an
      exceptional entry authorization for Devconnect attendees that exempts
      entrants from the regular Visa process. This Electronic Travel
      Authorization will allow you to stay 30 days in Argentina. Please fill out
      **[this
      form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/53k4rnjTGfCbHE81QEII2fyp6dtn5BA2Ie6XRx+USC0/)**
      to request your Waiver. If you wish to stay longer than 30 days, you will
      need to apply for a Visa through the traditional routes.
