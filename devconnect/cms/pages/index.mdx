devconnect_week:
  first_part: >
    ### Join our World’s Fair of Ethereum apps, grab a seat at the cowork, and
    co-create the next big thing in Ethereum.
  second_part: >
    ##### ETH Day will be the official Devconnect kickoff with ceremony, talks,
    and grand opening of the Ethereum World's Fair and Community Hubs.


    ##### **Make sure to plan your community events before or after Nov 17.** We
    will feature some community events on the calendar as we get closer to the
    event. In the meantime, share your events on X, tag @efdevcon or write us at
    [support@devconnect.org](mailto\:support@devconnect.org) with your
    questions.
devcon_vs_devconnect: "# Devcon vs. Devconnect\n\n### We, the Ethereum Foundation events team, create two unique events for you: Devcon and Devconnect. Both alternate biannually, focus on Ethereum and adjacent tech, and move around the globe. BUT, their formats differ:\n\n##### **Devconnect** started as a decentralized event week but has evolved into something bigger this year. Devconnect Argentina will be the culmination of a bigger effort to bring Argentina onchain. We’ll be working together with local organizations and communities and with the global ecosystem and **explore what it takes to bring a country onchain.**&#xA;\n\n##### This Devconnect will be more than a global gathering. In addition to focused community-organized events that will take place across the city, we will create a Cowork and an interactive “Ethereum World’s Fair” — a real showcase of live dapps, as a blueprint for what Ethereum can enable for a city, an economy, and a nation.\_\n\n##### **Devcon**, by contrast, is a huge conference and experience, a celebration of what the Ethereum ecosystem has achieved and alignment on where we’re headed next. It takes place in a single, massive venue. Over 4 days, attendees can explore talks, workshops, Community Hubs, a music stage, cowork areas, a decompression room, and much more.\n"

  - question: How does ticketing for the decentralized event week work?
    answer: >
      Each event handles its own registrations, but we’re working on a better
      info and schedule system this year.
  - question: 'I’m new to Ethereum, should I join?'
    answer: >
      Definitely! Devconnect is about learning, experimenting, and
      connecting—the “Ethereum World’s Fair” will be an excellent opportunity to
      learn about Ethreum applications and how they can be used in everyday
      life.
