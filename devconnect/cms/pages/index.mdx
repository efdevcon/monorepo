  # What is Devconnect?


  ## Devconnect is a decentralized gathering of the Ethereum community, with
  multiple events, a coworking space, and an “Ethereum World’s Fair” — fueling a
  local and global effort to **bring Argentina onchain**.


  ##### **Get involved in the Argentina onchain effort:**


  ##### Reach us at ethereum[@ethereum.org](mailto\:xxx@ethereum.org) or team up
  with others on our Forum. Let’s figure out how to push the boundaries of
  onchain adoption together, starting with Argentina.

  # Why Devconnect Argentina is different


  ### **A shared mission:** We’re teaming up with an already-thriving local
  community and the broader Ethereum ecosystem to support a mission the local
  community has already started: bringing Argentina onchain.


  ### **Real adoption, right now:** Argentina already has high crypto adoption,
  a crypto friendly government, and a passionate local Ethereum community
  working toward mainstream traction.


  ### **Beyond a Cowork:** Alongside the usual Devconnect coworking vibe, we’re
  introducing something like an “Ethereum World’s Fair”, where you can explore
  an interactive showcase of dapps and see how Ethereum can transform finance,
  governance, and identity in day-to-day life.

  # What to expect?


  #### **Big opening day on Nov 17:** Save the date, be there, and plan your
  events around this opening day at La Rural.


  #### **“Ethereum World’s Fair”:** Live demos, real apps, actual usage—like a
  mini expo of how Ethereum can power everyday life.


  #### **Holistic Cowork:** A coworking area with Community Hubs for
  collaboration, idea-sharing, and more.


  #### **Decentralized events:** Different expert teams will host focused
  gatherings across Buenos Aires, diving deep into the Ethereum topics they know
  best.
devcon_vs_devconnect: "# Devcon vs. Devconnect\n\n## We, the Ethereum Foundation events team, create two unique events for you: Devcon and Devconnect. Both alternate biannually, focus on Ethereum and adjacent tech, and move around the globe. BUT, their formats differ:\n\n##### **Devconnect** started as a decentralized event week but has evolved into something bigger this year. Devconnect Argentina will be the culmination of a bigger effort to bring Argentina onchain. We’ll be working together with local organizations and communities and with the global ecosystem and **explore what it takes to bring a country onchain.**&#xA;\n\n##### Devconnect in November will be more than a global gathering. In addition to focused community-organized events that will take place across the city, we will create a Cowork and an interactive “Ethereum World’s Fair” — a real showcase of live dapps, as a blueprint for what Ethereum can enable for a city, an economy, and a nation.\_\n\n##### **Devcon**, by contrast, is a huge conference and experience, a celebration of what the Ethereum ecosystem has achieved and alignment on where we’re headed next. It takes place in a single, massive venue. Over 4 days, attendees can explore talks, workshops, Community Hubs, a music stage, cowork areas, a decompression room, and much more.\n"
