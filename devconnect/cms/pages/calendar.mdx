  ## **Want to be featured on our calendar?**


  ##### We encourage event hosts to submit their events to the AT Protocol
  network in accordance to our **[event
  lexicon](https://atproto-browser.vercel.app/at/did\:plc\:dhnigydy24fp542wu5sxqy33/com.atproto.lexicon.schema/org.devcon.event)**.
  We provide a helper form for this below.


  ##### **While submission does not guarantee inclusion** — as all listings are
  curated — **it is a required step** to be considered for our calendar.


  <Buttons
    Button={[
      { text: "Submission Form", url: "/community-events", color: "blue-1" }
    ]}
  />


  ###### **As an alternative to direct submission,** we also receive events from
  community calendars that support AT protocol - posting to any of the following
  event platforms will notify us of your event:


  ######
  **[https://lemonade.social/s/devconnect-arg](https://lemonade.social/s/devconnect-arg)**
calendar_community_calendar: >
  ## **Want to build a community calendar?**


  ##### To make things simple, we collect all events adhering to our event
  schema and expose them via **[this
  URL](https://at-slurper.onrender.com/all-events)**. These are unfiltered and
  posting to AT protocol is permissionless, so we encourage you to do your own
  whitelisting of events.


  ##### You can also use AT Protocol directly — all data is public and open by
  default.
