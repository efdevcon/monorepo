ZK artifacts for supporting the `proto-pod-gpc` family of general purpose
circuits.  These files are needed by code in the
[Zupass](https://github.com/proofcarryingdata/zupass)
repo but are stored separately to avoid bloating the repo size.  For a full
introduction, see the [Developer Site](https://zupass.org/pod-developers).

## What's in this package?

These artifacts are used for GPC proofs as generated by the
[`@pcd/gpc`](https://github.com/proofcarryingdata/zupass/tree/main/packages/lib/gpc)
and [`@pcd/gpc-pcd`](https://github.com/proofcarryingdata/zupass/tree/main/packages/pcd/gpc-pcd)
packages.

These artifacts are built from the circom code in the
[`@pcd/gpcircuits`](https://github.com/proofcarryingdata/zupass/tree/main/packages/lib/gpcircuits) package.

For info on artifact downloading and publishing, see the documentation in the
[`snark-artifacts`](https://github.com/proofcarryingdata/snark-artifacts) repo
root.

## Stability and Security

The artifacts in this package are in an experimental pre-release state.
Compatibility with future versions (of circuits, artifacts, or GPC code) is
not guaranteed.

This package should not be considered secure enough for highly-sensitive
use cases.  The circuits are experimental and have not been audited.  The
proving/verifying keys were generated in good faith by a single author, but
are not the result of a distributed trusted setup ceremony.
