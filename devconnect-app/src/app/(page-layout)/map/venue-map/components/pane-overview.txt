Stages - 
    Link to stage page


Meeting room link added to each notion entry
Should link to index of meeting rooms

Meeting room icons? Do we want to do anything here?

I think we should visually differentiate between clickable icons and organizational icons 
    e.g. cowork computer icon, futbol football icon, etc.

Should storage be a POI?
