Calendar should display events in a grid layout

Events should be sorted by start date
Events should be sorted by end date

You should be able to click on an event to see its details
RSVP button should be displayed if the event is not full

Login should be possible

Questions:
Should we reuse logins from Devcon?
Graphically, what are the dimensions on the calendar? Is it time on X and place on Y? Are there too many locations to have location as an axis?
