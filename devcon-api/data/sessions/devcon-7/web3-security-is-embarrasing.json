  "title": "Web3 Security is Embarrasing",
  "description": "The explosive growth of Web3 has brought about innovation, decentralization, and financial opportunity. But let’s be honest—Web3 security is a disaster. In this talk, we’ll confront embarrassing truths: drainer attacks, weak wallet protections, and overlooked vulnerabilities. But we won’t stop there; I’ll share practical fixes to protect users and show how Web3 developers can raise the bar. If we want Web3 to thrive, we have to stop attackers beating us with low-effort attacks. We can do better!",
