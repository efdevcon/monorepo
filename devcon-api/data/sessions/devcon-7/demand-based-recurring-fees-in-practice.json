  "description": "ALL 4 letter .COMs have been taken since 2013. Yet most only have a few natural buyers; hence, speculation doesn't make that market more efficient.\r\n\r\nYet, in crypto-economics, we can already transcend private property to deter the monopolization of digital assets like domains. \r\n\r\nThis talk explores solutions from Weyl, Posner, and Henry George. We'll show how pricing and allocative efficiency can be improved through Georgist land value tax for assets like real estate, domain names, or ad space.",
