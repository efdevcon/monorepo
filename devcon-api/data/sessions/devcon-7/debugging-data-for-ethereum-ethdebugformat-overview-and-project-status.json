  "title": "Debugging data for Ethereum – ethdebug/format Overview and Project status",
  "description": "Building debuggers for EVM languages is challenging, time-consuming, and brittle because compilers do not provide enough information to enable robust tooling. The **ethdebug format** project, sponsored by Solidity, seeks to address this concern by designing a standards-track collection of schemas for expressing high-level language semantics in connection with low-level machine code.\r\n\r\nPlease attend this talk to learn about the status of this effort and a brief overview of its components.",
