  "title": "Bridging the Gap: How to Effectively talk to Regulators?",
  "description": "Regulators are eager to learn more about different aspects of blockchain. Over the years we can see is a growing interest in a dialogue with the industry participants and specifically technical experts. Now more than ever it is crucial for the community to speak with an informed and empowered voice. The workshop we are proposing aims to share all the knowledge we have accumulated over the last 4 years working with (mostly EU) regulators to empower technical experts and founders.",
