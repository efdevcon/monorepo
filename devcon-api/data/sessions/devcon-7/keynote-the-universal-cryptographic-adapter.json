  "description": "The \"secret\" third affordance of Zero-Knowledge proof after 1) Privacy and 2) Succinctness is Interoperability. ZK enables us to continuously refactor data, aggregate it from different sources, and transforming it without loosing its integrity.\r\nStarting with the Zupass project, and now with the broader adoption of the POD and GPC format, 0xPARC has been exploring using ZK for data sovereignty and creating more interoperable data ecosystem. We will cover our learnings and progress in this talk.",
