  "title": "Local Build: Why language is key to decentralization",
  "description": "Localization is not a “nice to have” for decentralization: it is a core requirement.\r\n\r\nOver 50% of ETH nodes are between the US and Germany. 90% of stablecoins are USD-pegged. The world we’re creating is stifled by the one that already exists. \r\n\r\nTo be credibly decentralized, Ethereum must be built and secured in the human languages of people outside of the current paradigm. This talk will highlight web3-native problems and tangible solutions in l10n, from the technical to the organizational.",
