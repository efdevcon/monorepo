  "description": "Exploring MycoFi guides readers on an underground exploration into the world wise web of mycelial networks, the most prolific producers of public goods on Earth. This talk examines how the evolutionary adaptability of fungi could help us imagine biomimetic alternatives to status-quo economic systems that demand infinite growth on a finite planet.
