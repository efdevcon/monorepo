  "title": "Building with Intention: Achieving System Qualities through Design Choices",
  "description": "Technical and design decisions should be viewed as means to achieving broader system qualities rather than ends in themselves. This talk reorients our focus on the underlying goals of these decisions, exploring why we build the way we do, what we aim to achieve, and whether there are better ways to reach comparable outcomes. Through examples and case studies, attendees will learn to critically evaluate their design choices and understand the broader implications of their technical strategies.",
