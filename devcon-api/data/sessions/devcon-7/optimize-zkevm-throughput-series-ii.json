  "description": "There are different ways to optimize the zkEVM, the one exposed in this workshop is through optimizing the zkASM (zk assembly) code itself so that it consumes fewer counters for the same execution.\r\nThe first 40min of the workshop is a deep explanation of the zkASM language, instructions, operations, counters, build... And the rest of the time we will be live coding and explaining in detail two optimized core functions of the zkEVM so that attendees can appreciate the before and after optimizing",
