  "title": "The Wallet and UX Stack to Build Web3 Applications for the Masses",
  "description": "In this talk I will give an overview of how wallet infrastructure and the relationship between wallets and dapps have evolved over the past 5 years. And give a layer-by-layer breakdown of the modern wallet stack from signers to smart account modules, how each component contributes to a UX unlock on Ethereum/L2s, and how application developers can use them today. We will also touch on pertinent ongoing EIPs such as 7702 (deploy code for EOAs), and 7715 (permissions).",
