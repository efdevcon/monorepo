  "title": "Behind Zupass: Applied Cryptography For Consumers",
  "description": "Recent advancements in cryptography on consumer devices (like your mobile phone) and progress in developer tooling (Semaphore, SnarkJS) have led to the emergence of open-source projects such as Zupass, a personal \"cryptographic computer\" helping power Devcon.\r\n\r\nThis talk dives into the technical challenges behind scaling ZKPs to 10,000+ consumer devices and the history behind the project, from its inception at Zuzalu to its usage at recent Ethereum events (Devconnect, ProgCrypto, ETHBerlin).",

  "transcript_text": " Hello, thanks Sam. As you said, there's going to be a bit of a surprise for you all. I know it's getting close to lunch, towards hungry times, so we'll make sure it's worth the wait. I'm Richard. I work at Xerox PARC, and I'm here to talk about ZooPass. But before I get into ZooPass, I actually want to first talk about Ethereum. We are an Ethereum conference. And one theme that we've seen popping up over the past, I think, few years especially, and few months even more",
