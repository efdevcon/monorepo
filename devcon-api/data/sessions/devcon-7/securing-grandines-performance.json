  "title": "Securing Grandine's Performance",
  "description": "Our project focuses on improving Grandine’s performance and stability through targeted benchmarking and profiling. By conducting a comparative analysis with Lighthouse, we aim to identify architectural optimizations, especially those related to parallelization. Establishing baseline metrics is key to this approach, as it allows us to focus on refining critical areas within Grandine for optimal, efficient performance, thereby supporting the robustness of the Ethereum network.",
