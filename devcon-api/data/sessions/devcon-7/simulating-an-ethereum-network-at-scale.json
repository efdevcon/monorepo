  "title": "Simulating an Ethereum network at scale",
  "description": "Previously, when Ethereum client developers wanted to test their ideas on the network layer, they either had to use a simulation tool that could be used only with some programming language or had to do network emulation instead, which requires a cluster of computers to do it at scale rather than running it on a laptop-size machine. This talk will tell you how to simulate an Ethereum network with 100+ nodes on a laptop-sized machine with production Ethereum clients.",
