  "description": "A practical endgame on issuance policy stops the growth in stake while guaranteeing proper consensus incentives and positive regular rewards to solo stakers. Viable reward curves for this endgame are presented. Motivations, impacts and potential downsides of an issuance reduction are in focus. A tangible framework is also introduced: never exceed an issuance rate of 0.5%. A stringent cap on issuance caps the inflation rate, solidifying ETH as trustless sound money with robust economic security.",
