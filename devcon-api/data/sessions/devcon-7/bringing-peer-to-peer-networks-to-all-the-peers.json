  "description": "The p2p networks of the Ethereum ecosystem generally draw the line to server nodes. True end users devices: mobiles, laptops, browsers, are excluded and use centralised APIs and gateways to access the p2p network. Removing sovereignty, censorship-resistance and privacy in the process.\r\n\r\nIn this lightning talk, we’ll review everything that can go wrong when trying to include resource restricted devices in a peer-to-peer network, using the most popular tools and libraries.",
