  "description": "With the proliferation of L2s and Dencun (4844), Ethereum has scaled. However, we have a new challenge -- fragmentation.\r\n\r\nNow we're introducing various interoperability standards across Ethereum and Superchain ecosystem from intents to low latency cross chain bridging primitives. What are these standards and what will enable? How can we create scalable and composable blockspace which enables application developers to onboard the rest of the internet?",
