  "transcript_text": " yeah hello everyone my name is Stefan Tessin and I work with the Remix team and my talk today will be about the rise of AI in web pre-development area I will be much more on the application side. And yeah, regarding what the AI can actually bring to the web environment, these are actually the main application fields that AI can bring a lot to. First of all, the user experience, where we can incredibly enhance how the user actually perceives the platform. And also the decentralized governance that AI can actually have to much more incentivize this term. Also the creation of digital assets, also DAOs. And we cannot speak about AI in Web3 without talking about fraud detection and also the security aspect. So actually, enhancing the user experience is pretty much easy. Here we have an example of the Remix platform where we have code completion, code explaining. Those are pretty much low-hanging fruits for those who knows how LLM works. And yeah, this actually also already provides a lot of input for the user, a lot of value. And next stage of providing value for a user is by having automated chatbots, like also AI support, which are integrated in the platform. Here again, a remix example, where the AI chatbot is aware of what the user is doing is always one step ahead in order to kind of provide the user a much more better experience and so forth. Yeah, also the AI can be used for creating personalized content, user feeds creating also ai bots that will be a safe as oracle for contracts and also provide investment recommendation and create digital arts i wish as we have already seen with nfts and automatically generate metadata for market visibilities on different platforms without sharing the asset. Regarding the security aspect of how AI can actually improve how we develop a Web3 application, it can actually provide a much more secure development mechanism. Just think about it when you're about to deploy a contract and there's AI around it that kind of pass the contract and for vulnerabilities and check pretty much everything what goes around it. And also transaction, there's AI maybe sitting somewhere watching the blockchain out in real time and kind of flagging fraudulent transactions and so on. So the AI is sitting somewhere and kind of doing behavioral analysis and profiling everything and yeah, flag bad stuff. Okay, the last thing I will be talking about is about agents. Agents is like a software layer on top of the AI model which actually kind of perform autonomous actions and have an interaction with AI in order to get out, in order to provide base values. And those agents are actually able of kind of doing vulnerability scans, help in improving the decentralized governance, and also regarding the decentralized finance, we can automate that aspect of the Web3 environment by providing best trading pairs, best price, best algorithms for that. And also the smart contract automation that the agent can actually help with. And yeah, I think that was pretty much my talk I am very much open to questions anyone with question I see the gentleman in the very back I don't think I can throw that far. Thank you. Hello. So I had basically two questions. My first question would be regarding the Remix AI. So I actually utilize Remix a lot for contract development. So what I wanted to ask was the answers that Remix AI provides, how does Remix handle hallucination over it? The second is, Remix AI on the back end uses LLM. So is that LLM open-sourced? And what are the things on which it is trained at? Are there specific contracts on which it is trained at? Like, are there specific contracts on which it is trained at? First of all, regarding the hallucination, I think it is a problem that you cannot actually avoid with the nowadays states of development. But we aim to kind of reduce that by utilizing state-of-the-art models and to be much precise regarding also the second question that will be the open the llama model we use the latest llama model which available on human face and yeah they are deployed and our back ends and very soon they will be able as a private person to run it locally at your own risk. That's all I'll say. Another gentleman? Over there. Yes. Sorry, I'm getting... Thank you very much. Very nice box. Thank you. I hear a lot of things that a lot of people are talking like how we can do better contracts how can we do better chains and i feel that we're talking too much about uh the core layer like how to make the things run and we're not talking of how to build and use things over it like like web apps, general apps, do you think that AI can improve here too? Or will it be bringing more to the table for client part and higher level builder part? Or it will be bringing more to the table for low level, like blockchain and contracts? I think it will be much more on a high-level perspective that I will bring that value. Okay, got it. Thanks. I think we have time for one last question, if there's any. One last question. Over there. There's a gentleman there. Yes. Amazing. Hi. Hi. My name is Moritz. I'm working on 42.money. We're trying to generate front-ends for smart contracts specifically. What is your vision on Web3 generation of UI? We see a lot of big players in Web2, but in Web, there's not really competition yet. I mean, my vision or my, the way I see it is that the future there is very much bright. We are right now at the beginning of the era of AI casing the Web 3 environment. And I think it is pretty much opened. You can do pretty much everything you would like to do. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Okay.",
