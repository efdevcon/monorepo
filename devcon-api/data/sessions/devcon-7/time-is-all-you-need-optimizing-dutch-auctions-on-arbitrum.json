  "title": "Time is all you need: optimizing Dutch auctions on Arbitrum",
  "description": "Dutch auctions are a common approach in MEV-mitigating mechanism designs. However, little work has been done in exploring optimal auction execution times.  Using simulations, we demonstrate how optimizing for a key metric — wait time — can achieve optimal execution without the complexity of existing systems.",
