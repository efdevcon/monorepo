  "description": "What makes something usable in a world where the internet is built on open source cryptography? This talk explores how we might consider choice a key factor in the usability of applications where we are owners of our data which we can port, wield, and disclose at our discretion with other data owners. I will illustrate how we are testing our hypothesis that cryptography can surface meaningful connections through demo applications that embrace choice as a key usability factor.",
