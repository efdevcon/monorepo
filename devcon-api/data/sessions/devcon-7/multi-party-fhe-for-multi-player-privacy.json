  "title": "Multi-Party FHE for Multi-Player Privacy",
  "description": "Privacy is an unsolved challenge for blockchains and decentralized systems. ZK cryptography gets us there partially, but not all the way. ZK enables “single-player private state,” and certain other kinds of privacy are impossible to realize with ZKPs alone. Panelists, the cryptography library devs, infrastructure builders, and application devs who have recently started to explore programmable encryption will discuss MP-FHE as one such tool for achieving more general privacy capabilities.",
