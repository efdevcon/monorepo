  "description": "35 years ago I began outlining a vision of how betting markets could offer informed credibly-neutral estimates on far more disputed topics. I elaborated 25 years ago on how decision markets could support neutral governance, and 21 years ago on how combinatorial markets allow estimates on all possible combinations for existing topics. Now in the last year, we are seeing substantial crypto-based trials, especially re governance. In this talk, I’ll paint a picture of where all this could go.",
