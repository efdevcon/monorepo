  "description": "This talk will show the geographical and ISP distribution of the nodes in the Ethereum network, the client diversity, the hardware requirements to run a node today, the power consumption, the storage load after EIP-4844, the block and blob network latency, the institutional staker distribution as well as the correlated failure analysis looking at EIP-7716. We will also show some projections on how  the network could look 5 years from now, taking into account peerDAS and fullDAS.",
