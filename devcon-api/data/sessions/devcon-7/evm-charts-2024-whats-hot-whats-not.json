  "description": "Thanks to the openness and transparency of blockchain we can study how developers actually use it. In this session we will compare the usage of EVM on mainnet from the last Devcon to this Devcon. Including questions like:\r\n* Which opcodes have become more/less popular?\r\n* Which precompiles have become more/less popular?\r\n* Has average memory consumption increased/decreased?\r\n* How actively are new features being used?\r\n* Are transactions getting more complicated?",
