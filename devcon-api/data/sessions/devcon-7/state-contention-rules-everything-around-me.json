  "title": "State Contention Rules Everything Around Me",
  "description": "State contention causes MEV, prevents parallelization, breaks gas simulation, causes transactions to revert, etc. etc. We'll discuss state contention in practical and theoretical systems (e.g. OS threads and type systems) and how/why synchronization primitives developed. We'll cover why state is contentious, what state is contentious, what can be accomplished by making state non-contentitious, and strategies for refactoring existing systems to reduce contention.",
