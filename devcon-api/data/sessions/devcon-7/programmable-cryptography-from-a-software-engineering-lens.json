  "title": "Programmable Cryptography from a Software Engineering Lens",
  "description": "Different cryptographic primitives have different affordances, especially when using them in practice, and especially together. In this session, we explore a new way of interacting with PCs at a software engineering level via a LISP like programming language. This language enables creating self-verifying graphs of computation.",
