We are building a data ingestion pipeline, "at-slurper", which ingests data from various AT protocol sources, and saves them all into a notion database

We do this because we are a conference organizer that have a need for others to submit their events to be featured on our calendar, and we want them to use AT protocol, and as long as they adhere to the standard,
we will add their event to our systems

We need:
    - a list of urls to fetch from, which we will curate 
    - a converter from AT protocol to our internal Notion database table (fields may differ)
    - some mechanism to stay up to date (cron job / every 15 min?)
