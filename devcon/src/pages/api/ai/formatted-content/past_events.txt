  about: "## **Devcon Editions**\n\n## Everything began in Berlin Kreuzberg in 2014 when the co-founders and earliest builders of Ethereum came together for a meet-up they named Devcon 0. Since then, Devcon has rotated the world. The journey went from Berlin to London, Shanghai, Cancún, Prague, Osaka and Bogotá. Each location brings something unique to the developer conference.\n\nYou might want to check out some details about Devcon’s history.

    description: >
      After a three-year-long pause, we emerged from the pandemic stronger than
      before and reunited in Bogotá for the largest and some would say, “best
      Devcon yet.” One of its most powerful aspects was the impact on the
      regional community and the involvement of the flourishing Latin American
      Ethereum community, which had organized 14 community events around the
      region leading up to Devcon.

      Devcon 5 brought the Ethereum ecosystem together in Japan in October of
      2019 for an event that featured more content and attendees than ever
      before. In addition to the conference talks, Devcon featured the event's
      first community run outdoor stage and experiential Park area, a powerful
      open from the City of Osaka, a celebrity appearance by the world’s most
      well-known dog, Kabosu (the original “Doge”) and so much more.

      Devcon 4 brought Ethereum's ecosystem and family back to Europe with a
      2018 event at the Prague Convention Center in the Czech Republic
      (Czechia). With 3,000 strong in attendance, Devcon was filled with talks,
      experiences, teams from a matured application ecosystem, and more
      enterprise support than ever before.

    description: >
      Devcon 3 was a celebration held around "Dio de Los Muertos" and Halloween
      in Cancun, Mexico in November of 2017. It was the largest ever Ethereum
      gathering at the time, with just under 2000 attending in a year of
      unprecedented growth in terms of network use, adoption and progress.

  - title: devcon two
    description: >
      Devcon 2 came alongside one of the most (in)famous moments in Ethereum's
      early history, as a set of Denial of Service attacks were launched against
      the network just hours before the event was set to begin. With many of the
      most formidable builders in the ecosystem gathered together in Shanghai,
      they helped to coordinate emergency upgrades backstage to restore full
      functionality to the network, moments before stepping forward to speak to
      the future of the network on stage.

  - title: DΞVCON 1
    description: >
      Only a few months after Ethereum came to life, DΞVCON 1 was held in London
      in November of 2015. Presenters remained hard at work on each piece of the
      original Ethereum roadmap, early dApp teams took the stage, and supporters
      teased the early industry adoption that was to arrive soon.

  - title: DEV CON 0
    description: >
      It all began in Berlin. Long prior to the launch of Ethereum, the earliest
      builders and co-founders gathered in the Kreuzberg neighborhood in late
      November of 2014 to outline their work and designs for the future of
      Ethereum at a meetup called "ÐΞVcon-0". A great resource to learn about
      the historical context and the early ethos of the project.
